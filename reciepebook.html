    <h2>HOME MADE DOSA</h2>
    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
   
       <ul>
        <li>1 cup parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup urad dal (black gram)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)</li>
        <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Dosa batter</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee (clarified butter) for greasing the pan</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Instructions:</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice and urad dal separately in water and soak them along with fenugreek seeds in enough water for about 6-8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and urad dal, and then grind them separately to a smooth paste using some water. You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your grinder or blender.</li>
        <li>Mix the rice and urad dal paste together in a large bowl, add salt, and mix well. The consistency of the batter should be similar to pancake batter. Add water if needed to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let the batter ferment for about 8-12 hours or overnight in a warm place. The batter should rise and become slightly airy.</li>
        <li>Once the batter has fermented, gently mix it again. If the batter is too thick, you can add a little water to adjust the consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a flat non-stick or cast iron skillet (tava) over medium heat. Grease it lightly with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of the dosa batter onto the center of the skillet. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. You can make the dosa as thin or thick as you prefer.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the bottom becomes golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>If you're making a plain dosa, you're done! You can fold it and serve it with coconut chutney, sambar, or any chutney of your choice.</li>
        <li>If you're making a masala dosa, place a portion of masala potato filling on one side of the dosa. Fold the dosa over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Serve with chutney and sambar</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet lightly before making each dosa.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Dosas are traditionally served hot and crisp. Enjoy them with your favorite accompaniments!</p>
       <p>Remember that making dosas might require a bit of practice to perfect the spreading technique, but the results are definitely worth it!</p>
